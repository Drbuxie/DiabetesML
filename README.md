# DiabetesML
Machine learning model built to predict of diabetes in Pima Indian women. 
I used the MachineShop package in R which is a comprehensive ML package and the dataset was from Pima Indian women dataset. Four models (gradient boosted model, radial SVM, logistic regression, and probit model) were assessed for performance and the metric of choice was the Brier score. The logistic regression model performed best in the prediction of diabetes using this dataset.
