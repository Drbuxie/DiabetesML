# DiabetesML
Machine learning model built to predict of diabetes in Pima Indian women. 
I used the MachineShop package in R which is a comprehensive ML package and the dataset was from Pima Indian women dataset.
Four models (gradient boosted model, radial SVM, logististic regression and probit model) were assessed for performeance and the metric of choice was the brier score.
Logistic regression model preformed best in the prediction of diabetes using this dataset.
